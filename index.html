        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I first entered the world of technology at a small advertising startup in 2011.
          After starting as a business generalist (there were only 12 of us at the time), I grew
          into a role as a product manager working on web dashboards for advertisers. I had 
          regretted the missed opportunity to become a web developer since college, so I was 
          thrilled when I was given the opportunity to join the engineering team and learn on
          the job.
        </p>
       
        <h3>Experience in...</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Backbone.js web apps</li>
          <li>Python (including Flask & Tornado frameworks)</li>
          <li>Google Apps Script</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
          I left the technology sector in 2015 to work for my family's small business
          in the hospitality industry. Now I'm ready to get back to the technology I love,
          while bringing back a beadth of management & problem-solving experience.
        </p>

        <p>In my free time, I'm a serial traveller who knows her way around power tools
          and really loves her doge named Starbuck.
