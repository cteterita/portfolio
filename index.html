              <h2>Hi, I'm Claire!</h2>
              <p>
                I'm a full-stack web developer located in Marin County, California.
                As a former product manager, I understand how to create thoughtful, effective, and
                functional web products from concept to production.
              </p>
              <p>
                I have worked at small startups with 4 to 300 people, so I know how to move
                quickly and provide structure for the chaos of early-stage tech companies.
                As a web developer with this background, I understand my projects' broader
                business scope, and I know how to prioritize, communicate, and get stuff done.

            <div class="item-double">

              <p>
                I first entered the world of technology at a small advertising startup in 2011.
                After starting as a business generalist (there were only 12 of us), I grew
                into a role as a product manager conceptualizing and implementing web dashboards for advertisers.
                Ever since college, I regretted missing the opportunity to become a software developer,
                so I was thrilled when I joined the web development team and learned the trade while on the job.
              </p>
              <p>
                I left the technology sector in 2015 to work for my family's small business
                in the hospitality industry. Now I'm ready to get back to the technology I love
                while bringing back management & problem-solving experience. I can't wait
                to work with a team of talented programmers who share my enthusiasm.
              </p>
              <p>In my free time, I'm a serial traveler who knows her way around power tools
                and loves her doge named Starbuck.
