              I'm a full-stack web developer located in Marin County, California.
              As a former product manager, I understand how to create thoughtful, effective, and
              functional web products from concept to production.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              I first entered the world of technology at a small advertising startup in 2011.
              After starting as a business generalist (there were only 12 of us at the time), I grew
              into a role as a product manager conceptualizing and implementing web dashboards for advertisers.
              Ever since college I had regretted missing the opportunity to become a software developer,
              so I was thrilled when I joined the web development team and got to learn the trade while on the job.
            </p>
            <p>
              I left the technology sector in 2015 to work for my family's small business
              in the hospitality industry. Now I'm ready to get back to the technology I love,
              while bringing back a breadth of management & problem-solving experience.
            </p>
            <p>In my free time, I'm a serial traveller who knows her way around power tools
              and really loves her doge named Starbuck.
